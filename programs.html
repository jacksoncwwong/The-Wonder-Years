        <h2>Our Program</h2>        
        <h3>At the Wonder Years Montessori, We aim to provide an environment for children where they are encouraged to learn by exploring, experiencing and refining the senses that are fundamental to their preparation for life.<br>
          <br>
          Our Program provides a total curriculum, which fosters optimal growth of children in all areas including social, emotional, physical, communications/language and cognitive development.<br>
          <br>
          A typical day would include a blend of structured and unstructured activities and is divided into the following components:</h3>

          <p>
          <h4>Become responsible members of society</h4>
            <h5>The Practical Life activities help students become responsible members of society. The activities help them learn and express a sense of order, independence, respect for the environment, respect for others, and at the same time, help to refine their concentration and hand-eye coordination. The Montessori Practical Life shelves are full of activities to reinforce pouring, spooning, tonging, dusting, sweeping, napkin folding, mixing colors, making bubbles, folding laundry, hanging clothes, using a screwdriver, locks and keys, screws and bolts, setting a table, using a whisk, etc. The activities are changed regularly so there are always new and exciting activities to refine the children’s fine motor skills and promote increased concentration skills.</h5>

            <p>
            <h4>Explore their senses</h4>
            <h5>The Sensorial area of the classroom comprises of scientifically designed material that help the child explore unique aspects of nature such as color, size, shape, etc. The child develops a deep understanding of these concepts using materials such as Pink Tower, Cylinder Blocks, Color Tablets, Knobless Cylinders, Smelling Bottles, Binomial Cube, Trinomial Cube and much more to explore through the senses! The child learn to refine his / her senses, acquire clear and conscious information and to be able to then make classifications in the environment.</h5>

            <p>
            <h4>Develope a strong affinity<br>with numbers</h4>
            <h5>Learning Math the Montessori way helps the child to develop a strong affinity for the numbers and its relations, using materials and activities to reinforce quantities and numerals 0 to 9.  The Montessori approach focuses on numeration and the 10 base system. Highly abstract concepts are taught in a concrete way using Montessori materials, manipulating them using senso-motoric experience to get acquainted with the principle and concept involved.</h5>

            <h4>Phonetics with interaction</h4>
            <h5>The Language area consists of a variety of materials to teach and reinforce sounds, writing and reading.  The child develops an in-depth understanding of phonetics, reading and comprehension using specially made materials such as name tracing cards with tracing paper, “Eye Spy” Tray, Sandpaper Letters, Cornmeal Tray, Movable Alphabet, Reading Cards, Sight Word Bingo etc.</h5>

          <h4>Science and art</h4>
            <h5>This area focuses on the integrated study of science, the social sciences, and the arts. Children are exposed to a rich, stimulating variety of activities based on hands-on learning experiments. Children first experience general rules of the universe, the planet, and the continents. These are gradually broken down into smaller parts such as continents, countries and towns.  A variety of manipulative tools are used to spark an interest in botany, zoology and geography and to help them explore and discover the world around them and help them become aware of the fact that they are part of the large family of humanity.</h5>

          <h4>Stay active!</h4>
          <h5>Outdoor activities form an integral part of our curriculum. The children’s outdoor play area consists of a play center to encourage gross motor skills, a covered sandbox, cedar playhouse and a path along which the students can draw using sidewalk chalk and cycle. This Montessori outdoor environment fosters respect and appreciation for nature and there are plenty of opportunities for raking, watering, planting, running, jumping, bubble blowing and discovering.</h5>
